Slides folder: usage & screenshot instructions

Files:
- `index.html` — slide deck (open in browser)
- `styles.css` — styling for slides
- `script.js` — navigation and screenshot mode

How to use:
1. Open `slides/index.html` in any modern browser (Chrome/Edge recommended).
2. Use the Prev/Next buttons or left/right arrow keys to navigate slides.
3. Press `S` (or click "Screenshot Mode") to enter screenshot mode. This hides controls and switches to a white background suitable for clean screenshots.
4. While in screenshot mode, use the browser's zoom to fit the slide if needed (or resize the window to 1280x720 for a 16:9 screenshot).

Recommended screenshot workflow (for Google Slides):
- Enter screenshot mode (press `S`).
- Resize browser window to 1280×720 (or use full-screen) for consistent captures.
- Capture screenshot (Windows: `Win+Shift+S` or Snipping Tool) or print to PDF and export an image.
- Paste each screenshot into Google Slides as individual slides. Use "Fit to slide" and center.

Tips:
- If you need higher DPI images, set browser zoom to 150% before capturing.
- For consistent visuals, keep the same browser and window size for all screenshots.

Keyboard shortcuts:
- ArrowLeft: Previous slide
- ArrowRight: Next slide
- S: Toggle screenshot mode
